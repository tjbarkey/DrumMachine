## Project Overview

### `Intro`

I created a simple interactive drum machine app as a quick build project. The guildlines and tests were devised by Free Code Camp. The app plays an assigned sound when you click the buttons or press the associated key, and shows the name of the sound clip in a box. The app crudely scales with the screen width.
